LIntent is still under active development and implements only a subset of
its planned features. The tool is currently in alpha stage; an early beta
version will be committed soon for testing purposes. We target daily updates
in the next future, when we plan to significantly extend and revise our 
type-checker. Reviewers interested in experimenting with the tool are
encouraged to check for updates in the next few days, when we will also 
upload some case studies to easily showcase the main features of our tool.
We plan to deploy a Unix/Linux porting for Mono as soon as possible.

Currently supported features
	- detection of attack surfaces for privilege escalation 
	- detection of over-privileged applications
	- detection of runtime failures due to under-privilege
	- detection of type mismatches upon IPC
	- secrecy of pending intents
	- support for Java annotations for enforcing and declassifying permissions
	- support for special Java annotations 
	- integration with Android Lint

Unsupported features (support will take some more time)
	- analysis of broadcast receivers
	- secrecy of IBinder's
	- support for Android (bound) services

A complete account of the features is presented in the submitted paper.
