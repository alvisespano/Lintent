Lintent is still under active development and implements a subset of
its planned features - pretty wide subset, thoguh.
We target frequent updates in the near future, when we plan to significantly
extend and revise our analyzer.
Reviewers interested in experimenting with the tool are encouraged to check
for further updates, as we will also upload upload additional case studies to
easily showcase the main features of our tool.
We also plan to deploy a Unix/Linux porting of Lintent for Mono sooner or later.


Currently supported features
	- all type reconstruction features of intents and components
	- detection of attack surfaces for privilege escalation 
	- detection of over-privileged applications
	- detection of runtime failures due to under-privilege
