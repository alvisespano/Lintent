Lintent is still under active development and implements only a subset of
its planned features security-wide, though it already offers most type reconstruction
features for intent and component analysis.
The tool is currently in alpha stage. We target frequent updates
in the future, when we plan to significantly extend and revise our 
type-checker with an informatio-flow analyzer based on the Decentralized
Label Model.

Currently supported features
	- detection of attack surfaces for privilege escalation 
	- detection of over-privileged applications
	- detection of runtime failures due to under-privilege
	- detection of type mismatches upon IPC
	- secrecy of pending intents
	- support for Java annotations for enforcing and declassifying permissions
	- support for special Java annotations 
	- integration with Android Lint

Unsupported features (support will take some more time)
	- analysis of broadcast receivers
	- secrecy of IBinder's
	- support for Android (bound) services
