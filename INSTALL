(C) 2011-2012 Alvise Spano', Stefano Calzavara, Michele Bugliesi - Universita' Ca' Foscari di Venezia

Lintent is currently supports Windows only with .NET 4.0 or better.
A Unix/Linux porting will be compiled very soon.


+++ Installation Instructions: Windows

- copy the contents of the bin folder (without the bin folder itself) into your Android Lint plug-in folder
(typically C:\Users\your-user-name\.android\lint)

- define a system environment variable ANDROID_LIBRARY referencing your Android SDK jar file
(typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platforms\android-16\android.jar)


+++ Usage Instructions: Eclipse

Assuming your Android Develpment Tools are fully functional and you installed Lintent according to
the instructions above, the Lint plug-in should work out of the box.
Just be sure that your Android Lint configuration enables Lintent as a valid plug-in and that you're running
Android Lint on an Android project you wish to analyze.


+++ Usage Instructions: Windows Command Prompt or Shell

From the command prompt you can use Lintent in client mode, i.e. forcing Android Lint invocation and
outputting results to standard out.
To try it quickly, open the command prompt or any Windows shell and type the following (where
<ANDROID-PROJECT-ROOT> must be replaced by the full path of the root folder of an Android project
you want to analyze.

$> LintentEngine.exe -v --client-mode <ANDROID-PROJECT-ROOT>

A verbose colored output is shown, notifying any type or permission inconsistency in the source code.
For further command line options try passing '--help' to LintentEngine.exe.
